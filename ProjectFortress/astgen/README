* Things to do with the Fortress ASTGen input
 1. Add comments to describe and give simple examples.
 2. Implement not-yet-implemented features in the parser.
 3. Restructure arrow types, tuple types, and tuple expressions.
 4. Separate nodes for functions and functional methods
 5. Rename nodes and fields.

* Criteria for the Fortress ASTGen input
 1. reverse engineering the source code should be possible
 2. convenience for visitors (vs if/then/else instanceof testing)
 3. use subtypes (classes) for variance rather than wrappers (abstract clases)
 4. don't propogate the subtype structure to enclosing method

* UIDObject
 1. It should have things for uniqueness.
 2. It should not include things that are applicable only for nodes.
 3. It should include things that are shared by nodes and the other parts of the interpreter.
